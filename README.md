# Mastering-Network-Insights: A-beginners-guide-to-TCPDump-and-Nmap 📡🌐

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Hey guys welcome to another cybersecurity project 🌐💻. In this project, I will dive into the basics of network security. TCPDump and Nmap are our tools of choice, this beginner's tool is essential in the monitoring and securing of our networks. Whether you're completely new to this or just curious to know more, this project is about the basics of keeping our network world safe and secure, so let's dive into it.

<h2>🛠️ Tools That I Used</h2>

- <b>[VirtualBox🔄-(Download the version for your operating system)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)</b>: This is an open-source virtualization platform that allows us to create and manage virtual machines (VMs). For our cybersecurity home lab, I would be using it to simulate diverse operating systems and network configurations within isolated environments.
- <b>[Kali Linux🏴‍☠️💻-(Download the VirtualBox 64-bit version)](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)</b>: This is a Linux distribution designed for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity activities. In this home lab, I will use it as our primary toolkit for conducting security assessments, vulnerability analysis, and hands-on penetration testing exercises.
- <b>[Metasploitable 🎯-(The link downloads automatically)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip/download )</b>: This is a purposely vulnerable virtual machine designed for penetration testing and security training. I will use it to simulate a target environment with intentionally weak configurations and known vulnerabilities, making it an ideal resource for practicing ethical hacking techniques.

<h2>🔄💻 Required System Requirement: I use an HP ENVY x360 Laptop (Not the best but it does the job)</h2>

- <b>[🧠 CPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1355U 1.70 GHz (Anything higher than this will work)]</b>
- <b>[💾 RAM: 16GB (gigabytes) of RAM (I will say 8 GB of RAM or higher will suffice)]</b>
- <b>[📀 Disk: 1TB (Terabyte) (500GB - 1000GB of free disk space will be enough)]</b>
- <b>[🔄 BIOS/UEFI: VT-x, AMD-V, or the equivalent must be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI]</b>
- <b>[🔧 System Type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor (⚠️MANDATORY: This is a must)]</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 1: Download and install VirtualBox from the official website. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 2: Download and exact the Kali Linux and Metasploitable tool to use in Virtual box. </b>

- <b>📝 STEP 3: After opening both tools, I ran 'ifconfig' on Metasploitable to know the IP address I will be hacking into</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 4: From here I was able to run basic Nmap commands to see what a vulnerable machine would look like. </b>

- <b>📝 STEP 5: We explore and practice: As I said we are only setting up the Home lab and connecting each tool, then using it for future projects. So keep watch for the next project]
